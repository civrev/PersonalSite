I am a 23 year old computer programmer who just recently started to call the city of San Antonio, TX my home. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of North Georgia and now spend most of my time building little projects for fun. I have almost six years of experience in the Army Reserves and am a skilled carpenter in addition to programming. My hobbies are hiking, videos games, and jumping into new technologies. I hope you appreciate this site!
