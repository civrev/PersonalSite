# PersonalSite
==============
This repository is the code for my personal website found here:
https://cwatts.azurewebsites.net

# Setup
=======
If you want to build a site like this on Microsoft Azure, I recommend seeing the sources to see how I built the site. The AzureCLI code is included in the setup script.

# Flask
=======
This site uses the Flask microframework because I wanted to learn something new, and my best stuff to show off is written in Python

# Sources
=========
This code started out as a Microsoft Azure tutorial here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python

to a plural sight course for Flask:
