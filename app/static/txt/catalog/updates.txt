This website is a web app in Azure. Whenever a branch is merged with the master branch in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/civrev/PersonalSite This site is built and deployed This simple method is done to utilize free Azure resources. Ideally, there would be 2 web apps, one is the preduction app you see and the other being the staging app that holds new changes. The staging app builds off the master branch, and when the build is complete it will send a message to an Azure message queue. That message will be consumed by some functions and run my automated QA tests on the staging site, which if they pass will send another message to	the message queue that will cause the sites to be swapped. Once swapped the settings that had the deployment slot app track the master branch will be transfered over to the now swapped production site, and the current production site will now longer track master branch updates.
